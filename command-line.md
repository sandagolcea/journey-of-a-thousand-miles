## Command Line

While the direct benefits of mastering the command line is not immediately obvious, it is definitely a key skill every developer should have under their belt.

You don't need to know all the commands from the command line interface, but there are some key commands that you will use often enough and some that will make life a lot easier for your life as a developer.

The command line is the entry point to all the inner workings of your computer, which brings me to the topic of scripts. As you advance you will want to automate some tasks, this is where scripts come in. The best developers are the laziest people, not because they don't do anything but because you create scripts to automatically run things they are too lazy to do. Assuming you are using a Unix based systems - a well written bash script can do anything - only limited to your imagination and skills to execute said imagination. A good grasp of the command line can allow you to write some very amazing scripts.
