## Javascript I -  Types, Conditionals, and Variables

Atwoods law: “Any application that can be written in JavaScript will eventually be written in JavaScript.”

Now we are at the fun bit! Javascript. It is both a client side and server side language, meaning you as a beginner have less of to a barrier to building your first web application! Not only can you build web applications with Javascript, you can also build games, mobile applications, and hardware (read: robots) with Javascript. Not many languages can boast of such verbosity. The best bit? Most Javascript resources are free! +1 towards knowledge for the people!

We want to make sure you have a rock solid foundation so we are going to take the syntax section slow. A solid foundation means you'll be able to write better code, know what to write when you want to create a complex logic in your web application, also helps you debug your code a lot better. Programming is not about writing code, its about solving problems, and these are the tools to help you solve problems.

We start at the very fundamentals - Types, conditionals, and Variables. Types, conditionals, and variables are used in all languages.

##### Javascript Types:
- Number
- String
- Boolean
- Symbol (new in Edition 6)
- Object
  - Function
  - Array
  - Date
  - RegExp
- null
- undefined

Reads like english doesn't it? It is like how There are different types of Animals like reptiles, and mammals. And within each type there are subtypes (subtype of mammal can be a cat, and there are many cats) and different types of animals have different attributes and can do different things. So reptiles are cold blooded, whereas mammals are warm blooded, cat are subtype that are warm blooded and have fur.

Numbers type has the traditional arithmetic operators that we use to manipulate them (plus, minus, divide, etc.), Strings come with their own methods to manipulate them as well (split, join, count, etc.). The same concept of having personal attributes and methods goes for all the other Types.

Computers are not smart, the people who write code are. Computers take everything literally - you have to declare to it what you are inputing. So, you have to somehow declare to the computer that hey, I want to add two numbers and not two strings. Hence the concept of types. You need to say what it is you are trying to manipulate.

You will soon realize that programming is a lot about transforming things into your ideal end state. Its like lego - you have all these different blocks and colours, it is up to you to transform these singular objects into your ideal end state.

##### Javascript Conditionals:

Conditionals are, as the name suggests, things that are conditional upon something else. For example, If else statements. These are not new logic, we practice it everyday - if it rains, bring an umbrella. Else, do not bring an umbrella. Conditionals are part of your tool box to transforming your code. There are other conditionals like While loops, For loops. Go add to your toolbox of transformation skills! Like mentioned, computers are not smart, you have to explicitly tell them what to do with explicit step by steps, or else if wouldn't happen or it wouldn't happen the way you want it to!


##### Javascript Variables:
New variables in JavaScript are declared using the var keyword. Variables are containers in which you store values. You can name your variables (makes them easier to retrieve later), manipulate your variables, compare variables, etc.  

Think of it like giving names to your cats. Instead of calling cat1, cat2 till cat99, which can get quite confusing, you can call cat1 Bob! You can then compare Bob with Felix (another variable or cat99), you can transform the variable Bob and make Bob weight less (or more if that's your thing). you can put Bob away and everything you about him will still remain the same when you pick him back out! That is a relatively good way to think about variables.

Variables are another tool in your toolbox for you to transform your objects into your desired outcome!

#### How to solve tough problems:
You will also realize that a lot of programming is Googling. Without a doubt you will run into issues that makes you want to throw your computer out of the window - do not fear, there is definitely someone else out there who has the same problem, and there will be another person with that same problem and has managed to solve it. The internet if your wealth of knowledge - If in doubt, Google. You will also start learning how to ask the correct questions on Google.

Along with Google is your other greatest resource - [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). There is an ongoing joke about how stackoverflow developers have the hardest job - because if it goes down they have no where else to turn to!

There are merits to struggling and figuring something out yourself - but if give it 20 minutes or so, Google it, Stackoverflow it, go for a cup of tea, if it still doesn't click - I'll be here to answer questions.

#### Your objective for this section:
- [ ] [Work through this first segment of Code Academy - Javascript.](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/getting-started-v2/0/1?curriculum_id=506324b3a7dffd00020bf661) This is a good way to go through conditionals and some Javascript types
- [ ] [Practice your first building blocks by creating an adventure game with Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-beginner-en-x9DnD/0/1?curriculum_id=506324b3a7dffd00020bf661)
  - These bits of Code Academy are free, there are a few segments that are reserved for 'Pro' users at USD19.99/month. If you are keen on signing up go ahead, but it is not necessary - the free segments have proven quite sufficient for what we are trying to achieve. There are so many good learning sites out there with monthly subscription fees, if we were to sign up to all of them, it would definitely add up to quite a significant sum of money! Even at USD19.99/month, it adds up to a little under USD240/year which can be too steep for some - which is exactly what we are trying to avoid, this is was created with the aim of open accessibility to knowledge.

#### If you would like extra practice:

- [ ] [ Follow along with Mozilla's introduction to Javascript. ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) It is a good read, but it would be even better if you can work along with it*
    - [ ] *Download [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=14660) & Use [Chrome dev tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools) to do it!
      - When you open Chrome, hit Cmd + alt + J (or if that doesn't work, right click on the screen -> select 'inspect element' -> select 'Console') to bring up the Chrome Dev Tools console! Try:
        - alert('omg I'm typing o n the console!')
        - alert(1+1)
        -  Try doing what you learnt on Code Academy here!
